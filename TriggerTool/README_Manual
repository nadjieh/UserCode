	IMPORTANT NOTE: We provide the numbers for lepton and hadron part separately. It is your job to cross them properly based on the given example.

How to use?

	- Befor starting:
		- Copy the dataset folder ("Nov2011AOD" here) to your current directory
		- Change the "GetInfoDirectory" method in the main classes approporiately if you DO NOT run the code in macro directory.
	- Assumptions:
		- We are in a loop over MC events and we want to extract the weight for ONE event.
		- We take *IsoMu17_CerntralJet30_BTagIP* as an example.
		- We want to analyze "all" category which is inclusive in N Jets and M B's

		- Total event weight:
			Weight = myleptonpart.GetLeptonTriggerSF(muon.pt) * totalEff;
