The previous info about prescale was not reliable since it was obtained by lumiContext which is not recommended.
Now, I followed what proposed by Dennis 
https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/singletop/432/2.html
https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/AUX/2011/11/16/14:03:20-40395-trigger_and_lumi_results.txt
and I recalculated the unprescaled lumis, found in unPrescaledLumi directory.
A JSON is extracted from this info, found in unPrescaledJSON. 

The total unprescaled Lumi is

172.764+46.957+163.989+4.291+243.013+139.027+542.731 = 1312.772 (/pb)
